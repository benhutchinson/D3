D3.js
=====

[D3.js](http://d3js.org/) is Javascript library that allows you to take some data, embed it within a document and present it in a variety of formats.  It renders charts in the browser as interactive scalable vector graphics with properties that can be smoothly animated and transformed.  It plays to the strengths of CSS3, HTML5 and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) and is well-integrated with geographic datasets.

###What Inspired Me
D3 is frequently used in the New York Times, such as [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/02/13/us/politics/2013-budget-proposal-graphic.html) and [here](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html?_r=0).  Its creative interactive features inspired me to learn more, especially the [Force Lay-Out](http://d3ben.herokuapp.com/chap11_3) and [Pack Hierarchy examples.](http://mbostock.github.io/d3/talk/20111116/pack-hierarchy.html).  The official examples page [can be found here.](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Gallery)


###What's In This Repo & Where Can I Learn More?
In this repo, I have simply chosen to work through [Scott Murray's](http://alignedleft.com/) fantastic tutorial book, "Interactive Data Visualisation For The Web."  The book [can be accessed here for free](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1230000000345/index.html) and I would recommend it to anyone that is keen to learn about interactive data visualisation technologies and geodata.  I would recommend a basic understanding of SVG, jQuery, and CSS before you set about the book.  [Joni Bologna's Pocket Guide To SVG](http://svgpocketguide.com/) and [my introduction to SVG](https://github.com/benhutchinson/Scalable-Vector-Graphics-SVG) would be good places to start.  [My files are hosted on Heroku](http://d3ben.herokuapp.com/) allowing you to quickly see the output charts in each chapter and how the tutorial builds.  My code is quite well-annotated in the more complex examples, simply for my own personal ease of reference.  You would browse through the erb files [in the views folder](https://github.com/benhutchinson/D3/tree/master/views) in this repo.
